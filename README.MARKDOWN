# 2b2t Player Database
## Overview
So after almost 2 years I've decided to come back and give this data an update.
I've ditched using Microsoft Access, if you still care to read the old database you can check the 
old readme with the link to it. I am now using SQLite, and have added databases for some
of the other data avaliable. I've also decided to release the scripts I used to scrape the data
as I no longer really care if you slam the website, I didn't tell you to. 

If you care about updating specific data there are the individual scripts for them,
however only the update_all.py script will update the lastupdated column of the
players.db players table.

That's all I got, enjoy.
